Vesuvius Challenge - Surface Detection
Build a model to virtually unwrap ancient scrolls.


Vesuvius Challenge - Surface Detection

Submit Prediction
Overview
Some ancient scrolls are too fragile to open, but that doesn’t mean we can’t read them. Can your model help?

Before we can recover what’s written between the lines, we first need to find the lines. You’ll work with CT scans from the Villa dei Papiri to train a model that follows the scroll’s surface, one of the trickiest and most essential parts of virtually unwrapping the text.

Description
The library at the Villa dei Papiri is one-of-a-kind: it’s the only classical antiquity known to survive. But when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD 79, most of its scrolls were turned into carbonized bundles of ash. Nearly 2,000 years later, many are still sealed shut, too delicate to unroll and too complex to decode. In this competition, you’ll build a model to segment the scroll’s surface in CT scans, a critical step in revealing the texts hidden inside.

Physical unrolling would destroy the scrolls, and today’s digital methods can handle only the easy parts, like clean, well-spaced layers. But the tightest, most tangled areas are often where the real discoveries hide. To recover those, we need better segmentation to handle noise and compression without distorting the scroll's shape.

You’ll work with real 3D CT data from the previous Vesuvius Challenge, which uncovered passages from sealed scrolls, including an ancient book title revealed for the first time. Your model’s job is to trace the scroll’s surface as it winds through folds, gaps, and distortions so the next stage of virtual unwrapping can do its magic.

Your efforts could help unlock works of philosophy, poetry, and history that haven’t been read in centuries. Texts that might have been lost forever—until now.

Let’s bring them back, one layer at a time.

Dataset Description
The dataset includes 3D chunks of binary labeled CT scans of the closed and carbonized Herculaneum scrolls. Data was acquired at the ESRF synchrotron in Grenoble, on beamline BM18 and at the DLS synchrotron in Oxford, on beamline I12.

The dimension of a sample chunk is not fixed, and can vary across the dataset.

Image showing the software used to virtually unwrap the scrolls

A papyrus sheet is composed of two layers, the recto and the verso, one with horizontal fibers and one with vertical fibers on top of each other.

The ideal solution is detecting the recto surface – the surface of the papyrus sheet that faces the umbilicus (the center of the scroll). The recto surface lies on the layer composed of horizontal fibers. Since the scrolls survived a carbonized eruption, the sheets can be partially damaged and frayed. Detecting, within a reasonable approximation, just the position of a sheet, no matter whether the segmentation surface encompasses both the recto and the verso, is also fine for the purpose of virtually unwrapping the scrolls.

Avoid topological mistakes: artificial mergers between different sheets and holes that split a single entity in several disconnected components.

The output of the machine learning model can be directly used in the Vesuvius Challenge pipeline to digitally unwrap (and read) the Herculaneum scrolls. Curious? Have a look at the latest tutorial on their digital unwrapping pipeline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHbpVcGD06U

Because the host team is laser-focused on unwrapping these scrolls, their research will continue throughout the Kaggle competition. Their annotation team will semi-manually unwrap additional portions of papyrus, and they expect to release both more labeled data AND ancient text as the competition progresses. Unlike the original training set, which underwent careful proofreading and refinement, these new labels will be less curated. Please use your judgment to decide how (and whether) each additional chunk should be incorporated into model training.

Evaluation
This competition uses a weighted average of three different segmentation metrics: Surface Dice, TopoScore, and VOI. See this notebook for a working copy of the metric and this dataset for the implementation details of each sub-metric. For general advice on how to optimize your submissions for the metric, see the Metric Summary section below. Note that this metric takes a relatively long time to run; you may need to wait several hours for scoring to complete.

Submission File
You must submit a zip containing one .tif volume mask per test image. Each mask must be named [image_id].tif, match the dimensions of the source image exactly, and use the same data type as the train mask.

Metric Summary
How We Score: Topology‑Aware Metrics for 3D Surface Segmentation
We reward surface proximity (SurfaceDice@τ), instance consistency (VOI split/merge), and shape correctness (TopoScore) so good unwrapping is not only accurate but topologically right.

Why topology matters here
To virtually unwrap the Herculaneum scrolls we must find the ink‑bearing papyrus surface—and keep it as a single, clean sheet as it winds through the volume. Beyond voxel‑wise accuracy, we must avoid mergers across adjacent wraps and splits within the same wrap, and we must preserve high‑level surface traits (no spurious holes/handles). Classic region‑overlap metrics (e.g., Dice) can look great even when these topology errors are severe. That’s why the leaderboard blends surface similarity, instance‑level consistency, and topological correctness.

Leaderboard formula (higher is better)
We linearly combine three bounded scores in [0,1]:
Score = 0.30 × TopoScore + 0.35 × SurfaceDice@τ + 0.35 × VOI_score

Leaderboard ranking uses the average score over all test volumes.

• All terms are in [0, 1].
• The tolerance τ for Surface Dice is in the same physical units as the case spacing, and it’s set to τ=2.0.
• Weights are fixed for the competition unless announced otherwise.

1) SurfaceDice@τ — Are the two surfaces within tolerance?
A surface‑aware variant of Dice: it scores the fraction of surface points (both prediction and ground truth) that lie within a spatial tolerance τ of each other. This respects that both labels and predictions may be off by a voxel or two while still capturing the right geometry.

Computation essentials: extract voxelized surfaces of prediction (P) and ground truth (G); compute nearest‑surface distances with case spacing; count matches when distance ≤ τ; average matches both ways (P↔G).
Edge cases: both empty → 1.0; exactly one empty → 0.0.
Defaults: τ = 2.0 (in spacing units) unless specified.
2) VOI_score — Do instances split/merge correctly?
Variation of Information (VOI) compares the connected‑component labelings of prediction and ground truth. It decomposes into VOI_split = H(GT | Pred) and VOI_merge = H(Pred | GT), which track over‑segmentation (splits) and under‑segmentation (merges), respectively. We convert the lower‑is‑better VOI_total = VOI_split + VOI_merge into a bounded score: VOI_score = 1 / (1 + 𝛂 VOI_total), with 𝛂 = 0.3.

Computation essentials: run 3D connected components (default 26‑connectivity) on union foreground; compute VOI on these integer labelings; map to VOI_score as above.
Interpretation: VOI responds strongly to component splits/merges and complements the shape‑level guarantees of TopoScore, described in the next section.
3) TopoScore — Are the topological features preserved?
Using Betti (number) matching from algebraic topology, we compare the topological features present in prediction vs. ground truth in each homology dimension k: k=0 (components), k=1 (tunnels/handles), k=2 (cavities). We compute a per‑dimension Topological‑F1 based on matched features, then take a weighted average over active dimensions.

Default weights: w0=0.34, w1=0.33, w2=0.33; inactive dimensions (no features in both) are skipped with renormalization.
Why this helps: detects bridges across neighboring wraps (extra k=1), within‑wrap breaks (extra k=0), and spurious cavities (extra k=2).
What each metric “sees” (cheat sheet)
SurfaceDice@τ focuses on boundary proximity; VOI captures instance split/merge behavior; TopoScore captures shape‑level topology.
See the table below for a quick mapping of common error patterns to metric responses.

Error pattern	SurfaceDice@τ	VOI_score (split/merge)	TopoScore (Betti)
Slight boundary misplacement (≤ τ)	Tolerant (often unchanged)	Usually unaffected	Unaffected
Artificial bridge between parallel layers	Local effect – May stay high	Merge ↓ (under-segmentation)	k=0 / k=1 (components and tunnels) – penalized ↓
Split of the same wrap into pieces	Local effect – May stay high	Split ↓ (over-segmentation)	k=0 components – penalized ↓
Spurious holes/handles in the sheet	Local effect – May stay high	Small or none	k=1/k=2 – penalized ↓
Evaluation details & edge cases
Binarization: foreground is non‑zero by default (or x > threshold if a threshold is specified).
Ignore regions: voxels marked ignored (via GT label or explicit mask) are set to background in both prediction and GT before all computations.
Connectivity (VOI only): default 26 in 3D.
Spacing & tolerance: all distances use per‑case spacing (sz, sy, sx); τ is in the same physical units.
Empty‑mask conventions: both empty → SurfaceDice=1, VOI_score=1, TopoScore=1; one empty → SurfaceDice=0; VOI_score near 0; TopoScore=0 on k=0.
Practical tips for competitors
Favor continuity within a wrap; avoid bridges across wraps (thin spurious connections are costly in VOI and TopoScore).
Mind connectivity: thinning/dilation can alter counts; check results under 26‑connectivity.
